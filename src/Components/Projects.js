      <p>
        I hold a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Engineering from the
        University of Pune, where I embarked on an enriching academic journey.
        Throughout this transformative period, I had the privilege of working on
        a multitude of projects, each under the expert guidance of experienced
        faculty members. Their mentorship not only provided me with invaluable
        insights but also honed my skills as a computer science enthusiast. My
        academic focus and primary areas of interest revolve around Web
        Development, Artificial Intelligence, and Machine Learning. Engaging in
        diverse projects allowed me to apply theoretical knowledge in practical
        scenarios, fostering a deep understanding of these domains. The dynamic
        and collaborative environment at the university provided me with a
        platform to explore cutting-edge technologies and innovations. These
        experiences have equipped me with a robust foundation in computer
        science, fostering a passion for creating impactful solutions in the
        fields of web development and artificial intelligence. I am eager to
        continue my journey, applying the knowledge and skills gained during my
        academic pursuits to contribute meaningfully to the ever-evolving
        landscape of technology and innovation.
